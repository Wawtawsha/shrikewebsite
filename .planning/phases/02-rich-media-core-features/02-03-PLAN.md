<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Install react-calendly and build ServiceSelector + CalendlyEmbed</name>
  <files>components/ServiceSelector.tsx, components/CalendlyEmbed.tsx</files>
  <action>
    **Install dependency:**
    - Run `npm install react-calendly`

    **components/ServiceSelector.tsx:**
    - "use client" directive
    - Import services from lib/services.ts
    - Display 3 service cards in a row (grid, 3 cols on lg, 1 on mobile)
    - Each card: service title, description, feature bullet points
    - Selected state: highlighted border/glow effect, others dimmed
    - Default: no selection (all cards equal prominence)
    - On click: set selected service, emit onSelect callback to parent
    - NO pricing anywhere — instead show "Book a consultation" CTA
    - Use useScrollReveal for entrance animations
    - Props: `onSelect: (serviceId: string) => void`, `selectedId: string | null`

    **components/CalendlyEmbed.tsx:**
    - "use client" directive (CRITICAL: react-calendly only works client-side)
    - Import `InlineWidget` from `react-calendly`
    - Props: `selectedService?: string` (to pass as UTM or prefill context)
    - Use a placeholder Calendly URL for now: `https://calendly.com/shrike-media/consultation` (user will replace with real URL later)
    - Style with pageSettings for dark theme: `{ backgroundColor: '0a0a0a', textColor: 'ffffff', primaryColor: 'your-accent-color' }` — match the site's dark theme
    - Set height to 700px minimum
    - Show a heading like "Schedule Your Consultation" above the widget
    - If selectedService is provided, display which service they're booking for
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
    - react-calendly is in package.json dependencies
    - Components compile without errors
  </verify>
  <done>
    - ServiceSelector renders 3 service cards with selection state
    - CalendlyEmbed renders Calendly InlineWidget with dark theme settings
    - No pricing visible anywhere
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire up services page with state management and scroll behavior</name>
  <files>app/services/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    - Replace existing placeholder content
    - Server component that imports client components
    - Page structure:
      1. Hero/header section: "Our Services" heading with brief overview paragraph about media production and technical consulting (SERV-01)
      2. ServiceSelector component for choosing service type (SERV-02)
      3. CalendlyEmbed component for booking (SERV-03)
      4. Brief "contact us for custom pricing" text near Calendly (SERV-04)
    - Manage state: Create a small client wrapper component (or make the page section a client component) that holds `selectedService` state
    - Parent component handles BOTH:
      a) State update when service selected (via onSelect callback from ServiceSelector)
      b) Smooth scroll to Calendly section using `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })` when service selected
    - Actually: make a `ServicesContent.tsx` client component that wraps ServiceSelector + CalendlyEmbed with shared state, OR just put a client boundary component inline. Simplest approach: create a single client component in the services page file that manages the state and scroll behavior.
    - Generate static metadata export for SEO
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` passes
    - /services page renders with service cards and Calendly widget
    - Clicking a service card highlights it
    - Calendly widget loads (may show error if URL is placeholder, that's OK)
    - No pricing text visible
  </verify>
  <done>
    - SERV-01: Services overview visible with descriptions
    - SERV-02: User can select service type from 3 options
    - SERV-03: Calendly widget embedded and themed dark
    - SERV-04: Consultative model — "contact us for pricing" approach, no prices shown
  </done>
</task>
