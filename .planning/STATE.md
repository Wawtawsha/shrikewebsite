## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Date | Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-08 | Milestone | Supabase for gallery backend | Storage + DB in one place, MCP tools already connected |
| 2026-02-08 | Milestone | Fully anonymous interactions | Zero friction for non-tech-savvy winery audience |
| 2026-02-08 | Milestone | Single /gallery route, re-skinned per event | Simpler than multi-event routing, swap photos and theme |
| 2026-02-08 | Milestone | No gallery link in main nav | Gallery is client-facing, shared via direct URL |
| 2026-02-08 | Milestone | Direct upload to Supabase Storage | No admin UI, owner uploads 200-1500 photos directly |
| 2026-02-08 | Milestone | Warm/cute design for gallery | Distinct from dark cinematic main site, matches winery audience |

### Active TODOs
- [ ] Research Supabase Storage + Next.js integration patterns
- [ ] Research masonry grid libraries for React/Next.js
- [ ] Define spam protection approach for anonymous comments

### Blockers
None

### Notes
- v1 milestone complete: 25/25 requirements, 3 phases (Performance Foundation → Rich Media → Cinematic Polish)
- Gallery is first client-facing photo delivery feature
- Target audience: women 30-60, primarily mobile, not tech-savvy
- First event: winery shoot, ~200-1500 photos

**Context for next session:**
- v1.1 milestone: Pinterest-style event photo gallery
