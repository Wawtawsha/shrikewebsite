- 33 test photos uploaded for vineyard-women-2026 event
- DB column is `author_name` (not `display_name`)
- CSS z-index blurhash approach is the correct pattern (not JS load detection)
- `toAlbumPhotos()` must always be memoized with `useMemo`
- Gallery accessed via direct URL only — no main nav link
