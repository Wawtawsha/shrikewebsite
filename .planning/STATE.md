## Project Reference

**Project file:** `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** When someone lands on this site, they must immediately feel they're looking at the work of elite creative engineers who can solve any problem.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Performance Foundation

---

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 - Performance Foundation
**Plan:** None (awaiting /gsd:plan-phase 1)
**Status:** Not started
**Progress:** 0%

**Next action:** Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create execution plans for Phase 1.

## Progress Overview

| Phase | Status | Plans | Requirement Coverage |
|-------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| 1 - Performance Foundation | ○ Pending | 0/? | 7 reqs (TECH-01, TECH-02, TECH-03, TECH-05, DSGN-01, DSGN-03, DSGN-04) |
| 2 - Rich Media & Core Features | ○ Pending | 0/? | 13 reqs (HERO-01–04, PORT-01–04, SERV-01–04, DSGN-02) |
| 3 - Cinematic Polish & Performance | ○ Pending | 0/? | 5 reqs (ANIM-01–04, TECH-04) |

**Total phases:** 3
**Total requirements:** 25
**Coverage:** 25/25 (100%)

## Performance Metrics

### Current
- Lighthouse Performance: Not measured
- LCP: Not measured
- CLS: Not measured
- FID: Not measured

### Targets (Phase 3)
- Lighthouse Performance: 90+
- LCP: < 2.5s
- CLS: < 0.1
- FID: < 100ms

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made
1. **2026-01-30:** Three-phase roadmap created — Foundation → Media → Polish approach based on research recommendations
2. **2026-01-30:** Motion accessibility (TECH-03) established in Phase 1, enforced in Phase 3 to avoid retrofit
3. **2026-01-30:** Portfolio and animation requirements flagged for review gates after implementation

### Active TODOs
- [ ] Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create Phase 1 execution plans
- [ ] Review research flags: Calendly performance impact, video codec comparison, GSAP ScrollTrigger patterns
- [ ] Establish performance testing device matrix (mid-range devices)

### Blockers
None

### Notes
- Research recommends foundation-first approach: performance infrastructure before visual polish
- Review gates set for PORT-01–04 and ANIM-01–04 — owner wants to evaluate execution before committing
- Depth setting = quick (3-5 phases, 1-3 plans each)

---

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-01-30 — Roadmap creation
**Session outcome:** ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, and REQUIREMENTS.md traceability created

**Current session focus:** Awaiting user approval of roadmap structure

**Context for next session:**
- Roadmap maps all 25 v1 requirements across 3 phases
- Foundation-first approach aligns with research recommendations (performance infrastructure prerequisite)
- Review gates established for portfolio and animation features
- Ready to proceed to phase planning once approved
