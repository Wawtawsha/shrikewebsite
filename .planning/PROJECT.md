# Shrike Media

## What This Is

A dark, cinematic portfolio website for Shrike Media — a creative engineering company that does photography, videography, and software/technical work. The site targets businesses needing media production and serves as both a portfolio showcase and a booking gateway. The site itself is a portfolio piece: its technical execution and polished interactions prove Shrike Media's capabilities.

## Core Value

When someone lands on this site, they must immediately feel they're looking at the work of elite creative engineers who can solve any problem.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Full-screen video showreel hero that plays behind the Shrike Media name on landing
- [ ] Dark, cinematic visual design with dramatic lighting and moody atmosphere
- [ ] Smooth scroll-driven animations, transitions, and micro-interactions throughout
- [ ] Portfolio gallery organized by category: Photography, Videography, Software
- [ ] Each portfolio category has its own visual treatment appropriate to the medium
- [ ] Services page describing media production and technical consulting offerings
- [ ] Unified Calendly booking integration for both media and technical consultation bookings
- [ ] Responsive design that maintains cinematic quality across devices
- [ ] Fast load times despite rich media content (optimized video, lazy loading, etc.)

### Out of Scope

- About/Team page — the work speaks for itself
- CMS or admin panel — content is hardcoded, updated via code
- Blog or news section — not needed for v1
- E-commerce or payment processing — booking happens through Calendly
- User accounts or authentication — public-facing site only

## Context

- Shrike Media is an early-stage media company doing photography, videography, and software/technical work for businesses
- The owner has real portfolio content across all three verticals (photo, video, software projects) ready to showcase
- Previous websites have been built (lawn care site on Vercel), so there's deployment experience to draw from
- The site needs to function as a sales tool — visitors should convert to bookings
- "Subtle and stunning" and "WOW people" are the explicit design directives

## Constraints

- **Content**: Hardcoded — no CMS, content changes require code updates
- **Booking**: Calendly integration — no custom scheduling system
- **Design**: Dark and cinematic — this is non-negotiable, not a preference
- **Performance**: Rich animations must not compromise load times — the site must feel fast despite heavy visual elements

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| No About/Team page | Work speaks for itself, keeps site focused | — Pending |
| Dark cinematic design | Conveys elite creative engineering identity | — Pending |
| Hardcoded content | Simplicity for v1, avoids CMS complexity | — Pending |
| Unified booking flow | One Calendly for media + technical, reduces friction | — Pending |
| Full-screen video hero | Maximum first-impression impact in first 3 seconds | — Pending |
| Category-based portfolio | Clear separation of Photography / Videography / Software | — Pending |
