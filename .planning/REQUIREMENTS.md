## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| About/Team page | Work speaks for itself — owner's explicit decision |
| CMS or admin panel | Hardcoded content for v1 simplicity |
| Blog | No content strategy yet; deferred to v2 |
| E-commerce / payments | Booking through Calendly, no direct payment |
| User accounts / auth | Public-facing portfolio site only |
| Visible pricing / packages | Consultative "contact for pricing" model instead |
| 3D / WebGL effects | High execution risk, can backfire if not perfect |
| Real-time chat | Overkill for portfolio site |
